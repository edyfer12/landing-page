# landing-page

This page shows the template on how a webpage or website is structured with header, body and footer as is used with WordPress. 

The template will appeal to business owners or prospective ones who want to market their business via website as a strategy
and enable them to only alter the content without the structure of the webpage to make it less time-consuming than to start
all from scratch. Business owners and prospective business owners can add images on placeholders, adjust font-size, change 
font-family, add captions underneath placeholders and replace existing text with their own. 

To create a template, flexboxes will be used to deal with complex CSS layouts, especially for positioning and spacing HTML elements 
appropriately. Background colours of blue, white and grey are shown to add attraction to the website.
